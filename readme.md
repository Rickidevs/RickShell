- `RickShell -ip 192.168.1.1 --port 4242`
- `RickShell -p bash -ip 192.168.1.1 --port 4242`  etc.

#### 🌐  if you are going to use it in the url, use the following command. this sets your shell command for the url (-ue)

- `RickShell -ue` / `RickShell -p bash -ue` / 
- `RickShell -ip 192.168.1.1 --port 4242 -ue` etc.
